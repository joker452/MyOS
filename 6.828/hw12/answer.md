* Mid-way down the left column on page 6, the Journaling paper says "However, until we have finished syncing those buffers, we cannot delete the copy of the data in the journal." Give a concrete example in which removing this rule would lead to disaster.  
    For example, a file move transaction (two operations: delete from dir1 and create in dir2, translating to writes to two different inodes, call them W1 and W2) could leave the filesystem in an inconsistent state if a crash happened while a second transaction started reclaiming space before the first one finished. Say W1 successfully gets synced to its original position, a second transaction reclaims the spot (W3), the system crashes, reboots and starts fixing the filesystem, sees that the transaction is committed and proceeds to sync all the metadata blocks. However, it's syncing W3 and W2, instead of W1 and W2. We don't know if the second transaction ever committed, but one of its updated metadata blocks, W3, gets written out to disk, possibly pointing at unintialized/free blocks and introducing corruption to the filesystem.
